ESC204 - Computer Vision
========================
This repository is for the Praxis 3 design course in the second year Engineering Science curriculum at the University of Toronto. We design an automonous system to plug a charger into a parked electric vehicle.

This repository contains code used for locating the charger port, using python OpenCV. It also tracks modular progress of our electromechanical systems. It's divided up into:
- cv = computer vision
- insert = plug inertion -> MG99R servo
- leadsrew = lead screw -> NEMA17 stepper motor with A4988 stepper motor driver
- drive = wheels motors -> 12VDC motor with 2x L298N DC motor driver
